title: The Next.js Upgrade
dateCreated: 4/5/22

That's right, after designing this entire website in all its beauty, I then had to uproot it because [react-snap](https://github.com/stereobooster/react-snap) wouldn't work. First it refused to work on the Ubuntu subsystem on Windows. Then it decided not to work on Manjaro at all. I then noticed that [React Static](https://github.com/react-static/react-static), which handled the static site generation, deemed itself outdated in favor of Next.js. The countless warnings from NPM about outdated packages should have done it, but the site was still building so I didn't care.

Now the site is built on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I'm refusing to do any more "uprooting" for at least the next 2 years. What's that? You've found the next best static site generator, and Next.js isn't it? We'll take a look in 2024. ;)
